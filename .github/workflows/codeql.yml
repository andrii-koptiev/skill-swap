                      - [ ] Handle sensitive data securely
                      - [ ] Follow secure coding practices

                      üìÅ **Detailed Results**: Check the Security tab in your repository for complete findings.

                      üîç Any security issues found will be reported in the Security tab and require resolution before merging.`;
